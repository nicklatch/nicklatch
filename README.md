# Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with knowledge in Elixir, Java, Go, PHP. As well as the Spring ecosystem, Phoenix, and Laravel.
  
My current interests include functional programming primarily in the BEAM ecosystem (Elixir, Gleam, and Erlang). I've also recently started to explore Laravel.

I also really enjoy digging into the nitty-gritty details of web service performance and exploring realtime systems.

Available for hire!
