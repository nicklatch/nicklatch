# Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves both web and systems programming!
  
My current interests include hacking around with Zig making temrinal tools, and building cool web things with Laravel.

I'm obsessed with learning things down to the lowest levels, and am probably getting nerd sniped right now...
