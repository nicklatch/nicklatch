# Hi, I'm Nick ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with knowledge in Java, Go, PHP; as well as the Spring ecosystem and Laravel.
  
My current interests include functional programming (Ocaml, Elixir, and Erlang) and deep diving into the Spring ecosystem.

I also really enjoy digging into the nitty-gritty details of web service performance and exploring actor based systems.
